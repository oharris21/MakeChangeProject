## MakeChange

### Intro
This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked for an item amount.
The user enters the amount.

Then the user is asked for an amount tendered,
enters the amount, and is given change in the largest denominations possible.

This project was assigned after Week 1 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding School.

### Technologies Used
* Java
* Java operators, especially %
* vi

### Lessons Learned
* I learned how important loops are for making the code shorter and easier to read for other developers.
* I also found it interesting how you have to account for the small inaccuracy of doubles when writing logic for their calculations.
